          <h2>Be Where It&rsquo;s At</h2>
          <p>
            San Francisco is one of the most exciting and vibrant cities on the
            planet. Bayside Beat is here to keep you informed of the best places
            to see, where to eat, what to do, and where to lay down your weary
            head after an action-packed day—or night—on the town.

        <h2>Riding the Cable Cars</h2>
        <p>
          No visit to San Francisco is complete without a ride on the iconic
          cable cars that climb up the vertiginous hills of the city. Of the
          twenty-three lines established between 1873 and 1890, three remain:
          two routes from downtown near Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf, and a
          third route along California Street.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cable cars rely on cables running constantly beneath the
          road&rsquo;s surface. The driver—or gripman—uses a lever to grip the
          cable to pull the car and its passengers up the hill. The gripman
          requires not only great strength, but also great skill. He needs to
          know where to release the cable to coast over crossing cables and
          points. The conductor works in close cooperation with the gripman,
          operating the brake at the rear of the car to prevent it from running
          out of control on the downward slopes.

          Although the cable cars are now mainly a tourist attraction,
          they&rsquo;re still used by local commuters to get to and from work.
          The California Street line is particularly popular among commuters on
          weekdays

        <h2>Cable Car Tips</h2>
        <p>
          A single ride on a cable car costs $6. If you plan to travel around
          the city, it&rsquo;s often cheaper to buy a Muni Passport, which gives
          you unlimited rides on San Francisco&rsquo;s extensive public
          transport system, including the cable cars (but not the BART subway
          system). Even a single-day passport ($14) will save you money if you
          make a return trip, and stop off to visit Chinatown one way.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are often long lines at the cable car terminus, particularly on
          the Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde routes. If you don&rsquo;t want to
          wait, try walking a few stops along the route. The conductor usually
          leaves a small number of places to pick up passengers on the way. The
          California Street route is generally less crowded (but not as
          spectacular).
